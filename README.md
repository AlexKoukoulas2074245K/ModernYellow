# ModernP
(It is time for a proper description rather than a cryptic readme message)

This is an ongoing C++ attempt to clone (for the third time) the Pokemon Yellow game.
It is implemented by leveraging most of the nice SDL libraries such as SDL_mixer, SDL_Image and the core functionality of SDL, and is being coded as platform independent as possible.

The assets were uploaded recently so if you so desire you can just clone the project and modify it. The only complication might be the header and lib folders in the project configuration, that should be pointed to the proper location containing the required SDL headers and libs.
